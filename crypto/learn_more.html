                <p><strong> Necessary Information: </strong> <br>

                    Important information that we will need in the investment process from our partners is: <br> name, amount of money
                    to invest and terms of investment (6 months, a year, etc...).
                    Because none offers too much of assurance in absorbing lost, <br> we believe in how our proposal can help our
                    clients to have the best investment option.

                <strong> What is an investment plan? </strong> <br>
                    An investment plan is a set of investing goals and a plan to meet them. Many individuals hesitate to start
                    investing because they are unfamiliar with the process. <br>
                    Some investors lose money from entering the market without a strategy. <br>
                    Investment plans inform peoples' decisions and improve the chances of satisfactory returns. <br>
              
                    <br>
                    <br>
              
                    <strong> Why Is an investment plan important? </strong> <br>
              
                    Strategies allow investors to consider all the variables. This way, the investor can gauge the amount of capital
                    they can invest while still meeting their other financial obligations. <br>
