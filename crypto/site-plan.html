      <strong> What is an investment plan? </strong> <br>
      An investment plan is a set of investing goals and a plan to meet them. Many individuals hesitate to start
      investing because they are unfamiliar with the process. <br>
      Some investors lose money from entering the market without a strategy. <br>
      Investment plans inform peoples' decisions and improve the chances of satisfactory returns. <br>

      <br>
      <br>

      <strong> Why Is an investment plan important? </strong> <br>

      Strategies allow investors to consider all the variables. This way, the investor can gauge the amount of capital
      they can invest while still meeting their other financial obligations. <br>
      Additionally, investment plans recognize and weigh any risks. An investor with a plan will look at every corner of
      the market to decide which asset types are suitable for their situation.
      Investment strategies help investors commit to a plan. Unprepared investors may withdraw from their assets when
      the market becomes volatile. <br>
      Planning gives investors the structure they need to remain confident through the market's fluctuations.
