    <p><strong> Hi Everyone, nice to meet you online!.</strong> I am grateful for the opportunity to be in this course and studying in the Lord's University. 
    I'm from Argentina. I'm a enrollment counselor working as a contractor for a company called Bloom. I returned from my mission 1 and almost a half year ago.  
    </p>
    <p>I didn't know, but I love programming <span>&#128187</span> and the possibilities and opportunities to create new things. 
    I love singing hymns and praying, it really strengthen me everytime. I love traveling and visiting temples.I love drinking tea mate <span>üßâ</span> (Brazilian, Paraguayan and Argentine mate).</p>
    <p>One of my greatest goals is to visit many temples in different countries and help people to know about the Gospel of Happiness. Have a nice week!! </p>
