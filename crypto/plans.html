                    This strategy is based on the nature of the stock market cycle, and capitalizes on the expected fluctuations in stock market prices.
                    Buy low, sell high is a strategy where you buy stocks or securities at a low price and sell them at a higher price.

                    Having a “long” position in a security means that you own the security. Investors maintain “long” security positions in the expectation that the stock will rise in value in the future. The opposite of a “long” position is a “short” position.

A "short" position is generally the sale of a stock you do not own. Investors who sell short believe the price of the stock will decrease in value. If the price drops, you can buy the stock at the lower price and make a profit. If the price of the stock rises and you buy it back later at the higher price, you will incur a loss. Short selling is for the experienced investor.

                    Long-term savings accounts are designed to hold the money you don't expect to need to spend in the near future. They're different from short-term savings or checking accounts that you might use to set aside money for bills, an upcoming vacation, wedding, or other one-time expenses.

                <p><strong> What is an investment plan? </strong> <br>
                    An investment plan is a set of investing goals and a plan to meet them. Many individuals hesitate to start
                    investing because they are unfamiliar with the process. <br>
                    Some investors lose money from entering the market without a strategy. <br>
                    Investment plans inform peoples' decisions and improve the chances of satisfactory returns. <br>
              
                    <br>
                    <br>
              
                    <strong> Why Is an investment plan important? </strong> <br>
              
                    Strategies allow investors to consider all the variables. This way, the investor can gauge the amount of capital
                    they can invest while still meeting their other financial obligations. <br>
